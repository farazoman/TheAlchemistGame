F4(7,6)I am the master of all things...not really, i'm just a weakling who stands here so people think i'm brave for standing outside when these monsters could attack at any time ... :( ... but really I know that they can't come here because the last warrior who tried to defeat the master saw that were afraid of salt so he placed it at the entrance but he's never come back from his journey since. bye...>(9,14)Welcome to the world of Mountain Land! Recently there has been a disturbance around our village and we don't know what to do. These evil creatures disturb us and start attacking us but it's not that bad near the village, it gets worse as you approach the top of the mountian. Their boss the giant monster controls them all and if he's destroyed then our village will be at peace, could you please help us. Talk with the villagers by pressing 'z' and you can find out more. We all really appreciate this thank you Bob! bye...>(3,7)Hello, I'm really scared here. I'm from the mountian and I ran here to stay safe and no one will let me inside their house, everyone's door is locked I'm scared :( bye...>(15,8)...   ....   .....    ...... .............. Oh hi there, did you konw that you can punch if you press 'z'? Also i've been told that the monsters don't like to stand next to you but if you were to go near them then they attack and they attack fast. So be careful out there.>
